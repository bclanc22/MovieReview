1 | Abstract 

Finding a new movie to watch can be a long process and take up all the time you even have to watch a movie in the first place. Our app is aimed to cut down on that issue and give users recommendations to new movies based on their favorite actors and actresses. A user can open the app and pick out a movie, let's say they like Forest Gump, they can know see other movies with the actors in that movie. They can pick out a Tom Hanks movie from a list of movies that he has been in. This will allow a user to choose a new movie much faster and save lots of time on movie nights.
